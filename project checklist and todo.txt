**Microcontroller Selection:**
1. Determine which microcontroller to use (Raspi or Arduino) through research.

**Virtual Pet Basics:**
1. Well-being Stats:
   - Hunger
   - Anger (secondary from excess/lack of other emotions)
   - Sadness (linked to joy but separate; can affect each other)
   - Joy
   - Anxiety
   - Tiredness
   - Weight (affected by average hunger over time)
   - Boredom (affected by joy, focus, productivity)
   - Focus
   - Productivity (linked to focus like joy)
   - Laziness
   - Hygiene
   - Sickness
   - Hostility
   - Allow setting these stats on first launch to give the pet a personality that aligns with the user's. Personality can change over time as the pet is cared for.

2. Real-time operation for the virtual pet.

3. Ability to write data to the drive on every sleep.

4. Consider adding a WAN connection to allow pet interaction with other picats. This could include a loneliness stat and friend detection for meeting new people when picats detect each other.

5. Include a unique picat ID and an online checker for living picats.

6. Explore the possibility of creating a webpage to check pistats.

**Modes:**
1. Study Mode:
   - Connect to PC to retrieve data and return well-being stats.
   - Video streaming reduces productivity, increases laziness, but adds joy, reduces boredom, and temporarily masks anxiety.
   - Coding and studying increase focus, productivity, and boredom, reduce laziness and hygiene, slightly reduce sadness and joy, increase hunger and tiredness.
   - Drawing and producing reduce boredom and anxiety, laziness, and anger, increase joy and tiredness, and mask hunger until the task is complete.

2. TD Mode:
   - Operate like an old-school virtual pet.
   - Player commands:
     - Feed
     - Watch TV
     - Play games
     - Walk
     - Read
     - Ignore (activated after a certain duration)
     - Talk it out
     - Throw (a joke, not a toy for the pet)
     - Abandon (if web-compatible, puts the pet and ID in the adoption center, revokes ownership rights, etc.)
     - Sleep (puts pet to sleep, saves state, turns device off)
     - Wake up (turns device on, wakes pet up, runs daily stats)
     - Give bath
     - Mode select

3. Wild Mode/Let Outside/Daycare:
   - Allows the pet to explore outside or places it in daycare with other picats if online.
   - The outside environment operates as a virtual biosphere where universal species stats determine the pet's health. Weighted towards real-life care, preventing stat exploitation without proper pet care.
   - Negative stats (hostility and sadness) are automatically added if the pet remains in this mode for too long.
   - The pet will be abandoned if all negative stats reach a certain point after a set duration.

4. Time:
   - Follows real-time (receive from the internet; use built-in quartz clock during a lack of connection for resource-saving purposes).
   - Tracks the pet's age.
   - Notifies milestones, important dates in the pet's life, and events (one day, one week, one month, birthdays, religious and national holidays, etc.).
   - Comatose state if left to sleep too long, requiring extra care to wake the pet up (duration to wake up could be determined logarithmically or exponentially).
   - Consider making stats harder to maintain

 over time, introducing challenges and goals.

5. First Boot:
   - Ask the player to select a pet (implemented after the first build).
   - Ask the player to name the pet.
   - Run through a list to retrieve personality stats.
   - Provide an introduction and tutorial with a chance to meet the pet.

6. Random Actions:
   - Pets can randomly bring gifts to the player.
   - Different moods trigger different actions to suit them (e.g., joy, cat jumps around, rolls; bored cat naps, paws at the screen; sad cat cries, hides away).
   - Consider adding easter eggs at a later stage.
   - If stats are consistently bad, the pet may run away, eventually leading to abandonment.

**Text:**
1. Cat's ability to speak to the player.
   - "Talk it out" feature for the pet to explain what's wrong or provide hints (e.g., if trying to increase a stat already at its maximum or neglecting something for too long).
   - Reminders of important days or the pet's whereabouts if not waking up ("The cat has been playing in the dumpster in the alley down the street. Call him back? Y/N").
   - Menus and notifications (e.g., basic summary of the pet's feelings when waking up, usable keyboard for first boot to name the cat).

**Daemon for PC/Phone Version:**
1. Screen time and activity monitoring.
2. AI system management (the brain of the system).
3. Setup for mobile unit and additional features like adoption center, received gifts, received notes, and possibly a graphical representation of stats.

**AI Systems:**
1. Speech synthesis using an open-source platform like Hugging Face, with an array determining the mood filter.
2. Hacking AI (reference Pwnagachi), heavily influenced by the pet's mood.
3. Biosphere AI balancing (ensuring a Darwinistic ecosystem).
4. Genome and UUID AI for consistent updating and ensuring each pet is unique, even with the same stats.
