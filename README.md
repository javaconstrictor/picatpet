 Although there is still much work to be done, the core concept is already in place.
 This project revolves around self-care. The idea is to engage with a virtual pet that behaves based on your own self-care practices. 
 Currently, it operates through manual input, but in the coming months, I plan to incorporate a system that utilizes data from your phone and other devices.
 This system will track your physical fitness, mental well-being, productivity. 
 It then creates an internal biosystem that competes with other users and aligns with your personal goals in a dynamic and intelligent environment where pets compete in a
 "survival of the fittest" style environment. 
 Additionally, there will be features such as deauthentication and handshake attacks, similarly to Pwnagachi
 specifically designed to enhance the experience by allowing users to acquire personalized notes from others (donated willingly for this purpose), mapping users, and helping
 increase willingness to socialize, or at the very least, spend more time in public.
 
 This comprehensive device is designed to showcase proficiency in graphic design, utilization of multiple learning models, implementation of a user interface in the second person, integration of various devices, proficiency in multiple coding languages, expertise in security and ethical hacking (white hat), and most importantly, it encompasses my passion for a meaningful cause-- personal health, and destigmitization of mental illness and insecurity.
 
 One of the most exciting features I have in store is the gene pool, where each pet will possess a unique genetic makeup tailored specifically to your device and yourself through the power of procedural generation. Furthermore, the "personality" and physical fitness of your virtual pet, representing you, will dynamically evolve based on your real-life behaviors and choices. I've dedicated an extensive amount of time over the past year to develop a sophisticated system that even allows your pet to gain weight when you're being lazy, adding a touch of realism and humor to the experience.
 
 At the moment, I haven't uploaded any files for my project. 
 This is primarily because I haven't acquired the artwork yet, and I plan to hire an artist or create the art myself closer to the initial release. 
 This approach is aimed at avoiding any potential licensing issues and ensuring that the project is presented in its best possible form upon release.
 I want to provide a polished and high-quality experience right from the start. 
 So, stay tuned for exciting updates! There are numerous fun features in the pipeline, and I can't wait to share them with you!
